# RMQ-Comparative-Study
A comparative study for three different implementations of the Range Minimum Query algorithms. The comparison is done both between the three algorithms and with the basic implementation one. The requirement is to create and generate a set of tests as diverse as possible to base the study on. The purpose is to underline advantages, disadvantages and compare the time and space complexities of each algorithm.

The implemented algorithms:
1. Segment Tree
2. Sparse Table
3. Sqrt-decompostion
